## Process

<< Insert Process Diagram >>

We manage KubeAcademy content development much like any standard software development process - by building a backlog of tasks that need to be completed, prioritizing each task, and having members of the team (and community) complete the tasks based on match in skillset, time and interest.

We have identified three different types of requests that will come into the backlog:
- Defects
- Course Update Proposal
- New Course Proposal
