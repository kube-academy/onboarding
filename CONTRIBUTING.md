# KubeAcademy from VMware Contributor's Guide

The KubeAcademy from VMware Contributor's Guide is written exclusively for instructors and practitioners who are creating course content for KubeAcademy. KubeAcademy provides free Kubernetes training for beginner, intermediate, and advanced skillset levels. 

With Kubernetes constantly evolving in ability, power and speed, so does the need to create timely, relevant course content with appropriate depth. It's the reason why KubeAcademy is always looking for Kubernetes experts in the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities who are interested in creating and reviewing course content. 

This guide includes instructions on how to:

- [Submit an idea for a course, lesson, or workshop.](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md)
- Write a script using the [VMware Brand Guidelines](https://www.vmware.com/brand/portal/guidelines.html) and the [VMware Marketing Editorial Guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/editorial-style-guide/marketing-editorial-style-guide.pdf).
- Submit a script to KubeAcademy for approval.
- [Download and install Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).](https://obsproject.com/) to record your video.
- Use the [KubeAcademy Course Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xq2wg6Q8TAucZ7qGy7dAjMpEBVuvqDPt/edit#slide=id.p3) to create a video of your approved script. 
- Submit a Defect Report if you find a defect in a course, course description on lab.
- Submit an Update Course Request if you encounter an inaccurate or out of date course.

## Can Anyone Contribute to KubeAcademy?

At the present, KubeAcademy is only able to accept course contributions from VMware employees because of the way our submission process works. We are currently updating the submission process so that any member of the Cloud Native or Kubernetes communities may contribute to KubeAcademy. 

To submit an idea for a new course, go [here](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md). We also invite you to check out our [GitHub Repository Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/kube-academy/projects/3) for contribution ideas. 

### Report Content Issues

One of most beneficial things the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities can do to ensure the integrity of content at KubeAcademy is to let us know when there is inaccurate or out of date content, or you find a defect in a course, course description, or lab. 

To report a content issue:

1. [Add the issue to the KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). The KubeAcademy backlog keeps track of defects, course update requests, and new course proposal ideas.

2. Do one of the following:
   - [Submit a Defect Report](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md) if there is an issue with the content you would like to report. If possible, include steps that reproduce the issue.
   - [Submit an Update Course Request](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md) to report a course that is in need of a major update, has content that is out of date, or is no longer valid, and should be archived.

## Course Content Types

KubeAcademy's current offerings include video courses made up of one or more lessons, an optional workshop, and (coming soon in a future release) blog posts. A description of the content is as follows:

- **Course**. A series of lessons that cover a specific topic of study. At KubeAcademy, all course content is currently created in a video format. When creating course content, you must include:
  - An introduction about the course, demo, or lecture.
  - One or more lessons.
  - A workshop (optional).
- **Lesson**. A lecture, demo, or combination of both for a course. A video lesson must be no longer than 7 minutes. 
- **Workshop**. A hands-on environment where learners can practice how to use Kubernetes. The labs are powered by [Educates](https://github.com/eduk8s). Educates is a Kubernetes Operator that controls the KubeAcademy training environment. 
- **Blog**. A piece of written work that corresponds to a specific course or workshop.

    Note: The FAQ "course" represents mini-lessons that do not depend upon other material. It supports both an easy entry point for learners and a way for contributors to get started with the video production format of creating courses

## Create a Video

The course developers at KubeAcademy use [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) to create videos. OBS provides convenient methods for defining scenes that include various input devices such as a microphone, camera or screen. OBS is a free and open source software that is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. 

### Video Course Time Limit

When recording your video course, remember to keep it under seven minutes. If your video is longer than seven minutes, you are going to need to edit the content to comply with the time limit. If you need help editing content, contact KubeAcademy for assistance.

## KubeAcademy Brand Requirements

Brand names, such as KubeAcademy from VMware, are essential elements of our company's identity. KubeAcademy encourages all instructors to use [The VMware Brand Voice Guidelines](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/brand-voice-guide/VMware-Brand-Voice-Guidelines.pdf) when referring to VMware brand names in a course.

Voice and tone are also important elements of the VMware brand. How you sound is just as important as what you have to say. Consider the following guiding principles when creating course content:

- Know your audience. Demonstrate that you undertand your learner's challenges and they will trust your solutions.
- Match the level of detail to the audience's level of understanding. Deeper connections allow for deeper conversations.
- Make it familiar. Talk to your learners as if they were in the room with you.
- Elevate KubeAcademy relevance. Unexpected examples that highlight KubeAcademy's unique approach and value can go a long way.
- Move people forward. Add energy to your course with short, crisp statements that include active verbs.

### Instructor Brand Apparel

An instructor who is going to appear in a video course must display one or more of the following brand elementsA bio is needed...

### Kubernetes Academy Brand Background

There are two different KubeAcademy backgrounds available. One is a dark background, the other is a light background. To get a background to use in your video, go [here]

## Script Writing Essentials

- VMware [brand voice requirements](https://www.vmware.com/brand/portal/guidelines/brand-voice.html)
- - VMware Brand Names are essential elements of the company's identity. When writing your script, be sure to use VMware brand names as adjectives. Do not use them as nouns, verbs, or in the possessive case.

### Start with a Video Brief

One way to start writing a video script is to first write a video brief. A video brief helps you organize your course objectives. It also causes you to think more about the needs of your audience as you plan content for your course. Understanding the needs of your audience is key to writing a video script that is compelling, relevant and succinct.

### Use a Conversational Tone in Your Script Writing

Write your script in a pleasant, conversational tone encourages your audience to want to keep learning Kubernetes.


[KubeAcademy Course Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xq2wg6Q8TAucZ7qGy7dAjMpEBVuvqDPt/edit#slide=id.p3)

Developing an outline is a good way to get all your ideas down for the script you are writing for

Write the script in a conversational style
Use the template below to organize your script into slides. This will help you create a rhythm for changing topics
Build and organize the slides for your presentation to mirror your script 
Use your script to inform the content on your slides by using summarized parts of your script, bullet points, or quotes
Create visual representations of your script to your presentation or request artwork for your presentation by emailing tpalma@vmware.com.


### Scriptwriting Guidelines

Write your script using a plain language that your audience can understand. When introducing terminology for the first time in your script, always provide a brief definition or explanation. 

Avoid unfamiliar acronyms. Avoid using obscure, specialized, or idiomatic language in your script writing. 

Voice: How we sound is as important as what we say. 

Active Voice. When writing your script, use active-voice verbs when possible. Avoid passive-voice verbs unless readers can easily recognize that the subject of the verb is irrelevant.

## Terminology Use

For a list of terminology that you cannot use in scripts or workshops submitted to KubeAcademy, go to https://source.vmware.com/portal/pages/global-marketing/terminology-changes.

When writing a script, do all the following:

- Do use words that are neutral and positive. 
- Do use non-violent terms. For example, instead of saying **kill the switch**, use **turn off the switch**.
- Do use terms that are free of ableism. For example, instead of saying **handicap**, use **challenge**, and instead of **sanity check** use **confidence check**.

- Do not use terminology that is jargon and slang.
- Do not use charged terminology. This includes words with shock value that demean, hurt, imply negative judgment.
- Do not objectify persons. For example, do not use **male** to signify a plug. Do not use female to signify a socket.
- Use gender-neutral terminology, unless it is relevant to the content. For example, use **they** instead of **he** or **she** and **person hours** instead of **man hours**. 

Choose terms that are free of Ableism



Don’t use terms in your script writing that imply negative judgment of differently-abled community members. 

Examples:

Use challenge instead of handicap.
Use ignored instead of falling on deaf ears. 
Use confidence check instead of sanity check.
Use non-violent terms


Don’t use terms in your script writing that imply violence, pain and degradation.

Examples:

Use stop instead of abort or kill.
Use run instead of execute. 


Gender descriptors
You can use gender descriptors in your script if they are important to the content 

Example:

If you are defining persona-based scenarios, you’ll need to identify male, female, or other-gendered designation. 

Exceptions to Terminology Guidelines
The Terminology Guidelines let you know the specific terms that you cannot use in your scripts.  You are still able to include words like black, master, and white in your script when their use is valid.

For example, it is appropriate to use the color white if you are describing a physical property in a neutral way, or the term master when referring to someone with expertise in a specific field.
Add Metadata
Always add metadata to your video or written content before submitting it to Kube Academy.

Metadata Tag
Description
Title
The title tag appears at the top of the web browser. It usually becomes a text link to your content in search engine results. When creating a title tag, lead with “VMware” most of the time. The tag must be unique and should include a key phrase or two.
Description
The description tag is a complete sentence (or two) that usually appears just below the title tag in search results and describes the content available on that page in a concise but inviting way. The description must be unique, concise, and specific, with the most important information presented first. 
Key Words

### Download and Install OBS

Read the [OBS Studio Quickstart](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart) for information on how to change default settings for audio devices and video sources. 

To download and install OBS Studio:

1. Go to [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS))](https://obsproject.com/).
2. Select the operating environment to install OBS. There are three choices: Windows, macOS 10.13+, and Linux.

   The OBS installer appears in the bottom, left corner of the page.

3. Select the OBS installer.

   The Auto-Configuration Wizard opens.

4. Run the auto-configuration wizard.
   
   The wizard automatically tests your system to define default settings for options such as recording, resolution, and, bitrate. You can manually change these settings later. 
5. Set up your audio devices by doing one or both of the following:
   
   - **For macOS users only**. Download and install [iShowU Audio Capture](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/) audio driver extension to capture audio before continuing onto the next step.
   - Verify that the default audio device and microphone are working properly. To do this, open the OBS Studio window and look at the volume meters in the mixer section. If there is a problem with audio or if you want to change the devices in use, go **Settings** > **Audio**.

6. From the Scenes and Sources panel, [add scenes for your video](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Overview#scenes-and-sources). This includes webcams and any other devices or media that you want in the output. 

### Configure OBS to Create a Video

To configure OBS:

1. Go to ? and download the following scene collection config file.
   `obs-kubeacademy-scenes.json`.

2. Go to [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and import the scene collection config.

   ![import scene collection](images/import-scene-collection.png)

   Three scenes display in the Scenes and Sources panel. These include: 
   
   - **ScreenCap**. Lets you capture your screen and mic at the same time.
   - **Camera**. Lets you capture your webcam and mic.
   - **PinP**. Lets you capture all three scenes. It captures your screen as the primary with your camera picture-in-picture.

     ![scenes](images/scenes.png)
   
3. Configure each source so that it connects to your computer. This configuration is necessary because the original scene collection file that was exported came from another computer with different sources.

   ![sources](images/sources.png)

4. Select the three devices. Click the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the pane. 

5. Open the preferences for OBS.

   ![preferences](images/preferences.png)

6. Select **Video** from the panel on the left. Set the Base and Output resolution to 1920x1080.

   ![video settings](images/video-settings.png)

If you make a mistake when recording an actual lesson, here's what to do:
  - Go back to the last transition point. For example, if you made a mistake at the point where you switched slides in a deck, go back and resume recording from there.  
  - Cut the mistake out of the recording later.

#### Test Record

It is a good idea to test record the three scenes before you do an actual course recording. Make sure to run the test for a few minutes to ensure that there are no issues. If you encounter one, go to [OBS Help](https://obsproject.com/help).

To test record:

1. Go **Settings** > **Output**. 
2. In the **Controls** pane, select **Start Recording**.

   ![controls](images/controls.png)

3. Do all of the following:

   a. Perform a test that includes all three scenes: mic, screen, and webcam.
   b. Speak a few words to test the mic pick up.  
   c. In the **Controls** pane, select **Stop Recording**.
