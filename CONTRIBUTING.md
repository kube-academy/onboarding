# KubeAcademy from VMware Contributor's Guide

The KubeAcademy from VMware Contributor's Guide is written exclusively for instructors and practitioners who are creating course content for KubeAcademy. KubeAcademy provides free Kubernetes training for beginner, intermediate, and advanced skillset levels. 

With Kubernetes constantly evolving in ability, power and speed, so does the need to create timely, relevant course content with appropriate depth. It's one reason why KubeAcademy is always looking for Kubernetes experts in the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities who are interested in creating and reviewing course content. 

This guide includes instructions on how to:

- [Submit an idea for a course, lesson, or workshop.](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md)
- Write a script using the [VMware Brand Guidelines](https://www.vmware.com/brand/portal/guidelines.html) and the [VMware Marketing Editorial Guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/editorial-style-guide/marketing-editorial-style-guide.pdf).
- Submit a course outline for approval.
- Use the [KubeAcademy Course Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xq2wg6Q8TAucZ7qGy7dAjMpEBVuvqDPt/edit#slide=id.p3) to create a video of your approved script. 

## Can Anyone Contribute to KubeAcademy?

At the present, KubeAcademy is only able to accept course contributions from VMware employees because of the way our submission process works. We are currently updating the submission process so that any member of the Cloud Native or Kubernetes communities may contribute to KubeAcademy. 

## Course Submission Process

KubeAcademy uses a GitHub repository to manage its course backlog. This backlog is open to the public, but as read-only. If you have an idea about a course that you would like to develop for KubeAcademy, you must [create a new issue in the KubeAcademy backlog](https://githueateb.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). In order to do this, a member of KubeAcademy has to create a GitHub account that gives you write access.

You also must complete the [KubeAcademy New Course Proposal] (https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md) as part of the course submission process. Use this form to provide specific details about the course, such as the title, description, prerequisites, learning outcomes and outline. When creating the course outline, be sure to include the sequential order of each lesson and workshop that you plan to teach in your course. 

To submit a course idea to KubeAcademy, do the following:

1. Contact the KubeAcademy Team on #KubeAcademy slack to express your interest in creating a course. 

   A member of the KubeAcademy creates a GitHub account for you that has write access so that you can [create a new issue in the KubeAcademy backlog](https://githueateb.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues) for the course.

2. Complete the [KubeAcademy New Course Proposal] (https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md).
3. Do both of the following:

   - [Create a new issue in Github](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). 
   - Copy the information from the KubeAcademy New Course Proposal and paste it into the new issue.

4. Wait for approval from the KubeAcademy team before you begin to do work on your course. 

   Once your course outline is approved, see the section, "Onboarding Setup".

## Onboarding Setup

Now that your course outline is approved, you can begin to develop your video course. To do this, you are going to need:

- Video Equipment
- Video Recording Software
- Powerpoint Template

### Required Video Eqipment

To get started recording your video, you are going to need the following equipment:

- Camera. A minimum 1080p Webcam or Camera. For example, Logitech c920s.
- Microphone (Use Webcam or External Mic such as xxxxx?)
- Background Screen (KubeAcademy Branded White or KubeAcademy Branded Black or a Green Screen.)

### Optional Video Lighting

Proper lighting improves the quality of a video recording. Though a light setup for your video recording is optional, it is highly recommended. There are several ways to set up lighting for a video recording. These include:

- One Light setup
  - Key Light
- Two Light setup
  - Key Light
  - Fill Light
- Three Light Setup
  - Key
  - Fill
  - Rear

### Video Recording Software

The course developers at KubeAcademy use [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) to create videos. OBS provides convenient methods for defining scenes that include various input devices such as a microphone, camera or screen. OBS is a free and open source software that is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. 

For specific instructions on how to configure OBS for Kube Academy videos, refer to [OBS](obs.md)

## KubeAcademy Brand Requirements

Brand names, such as KubeAcademy from VMware, are essential elements of our company's identity. KubeAcademy encourages all instructors to use [The VMware Brand Voice Guidelines](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/brand-voice-guide/VMware-Brand-Voice-Guidelines.pdf) when referring to VMware brand names in a course.

### Instructor Brand Apparel

An instructor who is going to appear in a video course must display one or more of the following brand elements

An instructor bio is needed.

### Kubernetes Academy Brand Background

There are two different KubeAcademy backgrounds available. One is a dark background, the other is a light background. To get a background to use in your video, go [here] 

## Scriptwriting Guidelines

Write your script in a pleasant, conversational tone that encourages your audience to want to keep learning Kubernetes. Use active-voice verbs whenever possible, and stay away from passive-voice verbs as much as possible. Use a plain language that your audience can understand. When introducing a term for the first time, make sure to provide a brief definition or explanation. For specialized terminology and brand names, always introduce the full term on the first reference along with its corresponding acronym, if you plan to continue referencing it.

When writing your script, refer to the [VMware Marketing Editorial Style Guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/editorial-style-guide/marketing-editorial-style-guide.pdf) for specific instructions on branding, voice and tone, and inclusive terminology.        

### Use a Conversational Voice and Tone in Your Script Writing

Voice and tone are important elements of the VMware brand. How we sound is as important as what we say. 

Consider the following guiding principles when creating course content:

- Know your audience. Demonstrate that you undertand your learner's challenges and they will trust your solutions.
- Match the level of detail to the audience's level of understanding. Deeper connections allow for deeper conversations.
- Make it familiar. Talk to your learners as if they were in the room with you.
- Elevate KubeAcademy relevance. Unexpected examples that highlight KubeAcademy's unique approach and value can go a long way.
- Move people forward. Add energy to your course with short, crisp statements that include active verbs.

### Terminology Use

The following terminology guidelines identify specific types of terms that you cannot use in your scripts. For a list of terminology that you cannot use in scripts or workshops submitted to KubeAcademy, go to https://source.vmware.com/portal/pages/global-marketing/terminology-changes.

When writing a script, consider the following terminology do's and do not's.

- Do use words that are neutral and positive. 
- Do use gender-neutral terminology, unless it is relevant to the content. For example, use **they** instead of **he** or **she** and **person hours** instead of **man hours**. 
- Do use non-violent terms that imply pain or degradation. For example, use **turn off the switches** instead of **kill the switch**.
- Do use terms that are free of ableism. For example, use **challenge** instead of **handicap**; use **sanity check** instead of **confidence check**.
- Do not use terminology that is jargon and slang.
- Do not use charged terminology. This includes words with shock value that demean, hurt, imply negative judgment.
- Do not objectify persons. For example, do not use **male** to signify a plug. Do not use female to signify a socket.

### Submit Your Script

To submit your script for review, upload it [here]. 

#### Test Record

It is a good idea to test record the three scenes before you do an actual course recording. Make sure to run the test for a few minutes to ensure that there are no issues. If you encounter one, go to [OBS Help](https://obsproject.com/help).

To test record:

1. Go **Settings** > **Output**. 
2. In the **Controls** pane, select **Start Recording**.

   ![controls](recording/images/controls.png)

3. Do all of the following:

   a. Perform a test that includes all three scenes: mic, screen, and webcam.
   b. Speak a few words to test the mic pick up.  
   c. In the **Controls** pane, select **Stop Recording**.

### Video Course Time Limit

When recording your video course, remember to keep it under seven minutes. If your video is longer than seven minutes, you are going to need to edit the content to comply with the time limit. If you need help editing content, contact KubeAcademy for assistance.

## Deploy Content
Deploying content to a public, production environment requires a number of steps. The following diagram covers many of the major steps. The blue boxes reflect activities most content contributors are actively engaged in doing.

![Image](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQAcCAMyF1Gce3rpXToIyX02qoEFRf55gU9SbOprQaL1KE4nPjMvKWE5XqGI8zLYTG6stQ3Vq-HPYSH/pub?w=960&h=720)

We manage KubeAcademy content development much like any standard software development process - by building a backlog of tasks that need to be completed, prioritizing each task, and having members of the team (and community) complete the tasks based on match in skillset, time and interest.

### Report Content Issues

One of most beneficial things the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities can do to ensure the integrity of content at KubeAcademy is to let us know when there is inaccurate or out of date content, or you find a defect in a course, course description, or lab. 

To report a content issue:

1. [Add the issue to the KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). The KubeAcademy backlog keeps track of defects, course update requests, and new course proposal ideas.

2. Do one of the following:
   - [Submit a Defect Report](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md) if there is an issue with the content you would like to report. If possible, include steps that reproduce the issue.
   - [Submit an Update Course Request](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md) to report a course that is in need of a major update, has content that is out of date, or is no longer valid, and should be archived.
