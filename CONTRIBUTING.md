# How to Contribute Content to KubeAcademy from VMware
Thank you for your interest in wanting to contribute content to KubeAcademy from VMware. KubeAcademy provides free Kubernetes training for beginner, intermediate, and advanced skillset levels. We invite you to check out our [backlog of course topics](https://github.com/orgs/kube-academy/projects/3) for contribution ideas. We also welcome ideas for developing new courses. To submit your proposal for a new course, go [here](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/new-course.md).

## About the KubeAcademy Contributor's Guide

The KubeAcademy Contributor's Guide is specifically for those developing content for KubeAcademy. It includes instructions on how to:
- Create a course, lesson, or lab.
- Write a script to read as you record the course, lesson or lab.
- Download and install Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to record your video.

## Can Anyone Contribute to KubeAcademy?
KubeAcademy is currently only able to accept course contributions from VMware employees. The good news is plans are underway to change the submission process so that any member of the Cloud Native or Kubernetes communities may contribute to KubeAcademy. In the meantime, you can help by reporting any [defects](#Defects) you encounter on KubeAcademy.

KubeAcademy is built with a love and passion for the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities. The Cloud Native ecosystem moves fast. Covering each area with appropriate depth is challenging. This is why we need community contributions to keep up in this fast moving space. It is why we are seeking experienced practioners to contribute content, review content, and even provide feedback on how best to streamline the content contribution process.

### Is KubeAcademy on Slack?
Yes. You can reach at any time through the #KubeAcademy Slack channel on VMware Slack. This is where you can let us know of your interest to contribute to KubeAcademy. 

## Content Creation Process
This document describes the content creation process for KubeAcademy courses, lessons and labs. This includes setup instructions on how to record a video, and steps on how to write a script.

### Courses

Each course is comprised of multiple lessons which cover specific topics related to the course.  Our courses are presented in video format delivered by instructures as a lecture or a demo (or both).  We also have recently introduced labs that provide learners with a hands-on environment and is powered by [Educates](https://github.com/eduk8s).

When creating a course, ensure it includes all the following:
- An introduction that summarizes the lecture.
- The course is comprised of one or more lessons
- A couse may optionally include a Lab
- A course must have an Intro Lecture 

### Lessons

Lessons for KubeAcademy must be under 10 minutes; Lessons for KubeAcademy Pro have no maximum time limit.

- Lessons can be:
    - Standard Video Lecture
    - Video Demo
    - Combination Video Lecture and Demo
      **Note:** 

### Labs

Labs are developed using [Educates](https://github.com/eduk8s).

#### Exception: FAQ Course

One exception to the above definition of a course is the FAQ "course". The intent of the FAQ "course" is to represent short bite-sized lessons that do not depend upon other material. It supports both an easy entry point for learners and a way for contributors to get started with the video production format of creating courses

### Other Content

(Coming Soon) In addition to video content, we are planning future releases to include written content in the form of Articles.

### Recording Video Content

See our document on [recording lessons with OBS](recording/obs.md) to get started recording video content.

## Process
Deploying anything to a public/produciton environment requires a number of steps that often go undocumented. In the interest of completeness, the following diagram covers many of the major steps. The boxes shaded in blue are intended to reflect activities most content contributors will be actively engaged in.

We manage KubeAcademy content development much like any standard software development process - by building a backlog of tasks that need to be completed, prioritizing each task, and having members of the team (and community) complete the tasks based on match in skillset, time and interest.

We have identified three different types of requests that will come into the backlog:
- Defects
- Course Update Proposal
- New Course Proposal

> **_Note:_** We are using Github Issues for managing the document process. While the site content is not in the repository, we are exposing a repository, backlog, for communicating requests and reporting issues.

### Course Update Proposal
Beyond defects, when a course becomes out of date or needs more signifiant change than can be captured in a defect report, please make a request using the following course update template:
