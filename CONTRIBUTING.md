## Process

<< Insert Process Diagram >>

We manage KubeAcademy content development much like any standard software development process - by building a backlog of tasks that need to be completed, prioritizing each task, and having members of the team (and community) complete the tasks based on match in skillset, time and interest.

We have identified three different types of requests that will come into the backlog:
- Defects
- Course Update Proposal
- New Course Proposal

### Defects

Content,like software will have defects. If you identify anything incorrect in the website, in a course or lecture content, please submit a Github Issue here:

### Course Update Proposal

Beyond defects, when a course becomes out of date or needs more signifiant change than can be captured in a defect report, please make a request using the following course update propsal:
