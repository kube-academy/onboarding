# KubeAcademy

## Mission
Our mission is to lower the barrier to entry for anyone wanting to learn and adopt Kubernetes by providing free Kubernetes knowledge, directly from experienced practitioners.

## Tagline
Learn Kubernetes from experts, for free

## Purpose
The purpose of KubeAcademy is to provide free educational material that focuses on exploring how Kuberentes solves business problems and how to successfully implement Kubernetes. KubeAcademy will discuss open source projects and commercial products in the context of problems they solve but is not a substitute for product education on Tanzu or any other commercial product. This material will always be free, and is not targeted at a specific distribution or implementation of Kubernetes.
