# Content Contributions

There are three ways to contribute content at KubeAcademy. You can:

- [Report Content Bugs](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md). Complete this form if there is a content bug that you would like to report. If possible, include the steps reproduce the issue.
- [Enhance Existing Content](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md). Complete this form if you find content that requires an update, or if you believe the content is no longer valid, and should be archived.
- [Submit a New Content Proposal][KubeAcademy content backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). This is where you go to start the content proposal process. For step-by-step instructions, see [How to Submit a Content Proposal](contributors-guide/how-to-submit-a-content-proposal.md).

Note: At the present, KubeAcademy is only able to accept new content proposals from VMware employees. This is because of the way the submission process is setup. This process is being updated to allow Kubernetes enthusiasts from around the globe the ability to submit a content proposal to KubeAcademy.
