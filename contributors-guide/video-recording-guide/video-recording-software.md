# Video Recording Software

The content developers at KubeAcademy use [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) to record videos. It is a free and open source software that is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. OBS lets you set up scenes for input devices such as a microphone, camera or screen.  

For instructions on how to configure OBS for Kube Academy videos, see [OBS](obs.md).
