# Hello World Video Sample

A **Hello World** video is a 1 - 3 minute sample video that you create and submit to the KubeAcademy before you start recording the new course. This is so the KubeAcademy team can ensure that OBS, your video and mic are working properly, and to assist you with any issues if they are not.

## How to Create a Hello World Video Sample

To create a Hello World video sample with sound:

1. Open the [KubeAcademy PowerPoint New Course Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hD6-2eKwSTa1WJKSJq_mj3NRS3K_5HOD/view?usp=sharing) in the KubeAcademy Onboarding Google Docs folder.
2. From the template, go **File** > **Make a Copy** > **Entire Presentation**.
3. From the template copy, go **File** > **Rename** to rename your Hello World video sample. Save it to your GitHub folder containing the templates.
4. In Slide 1, do all the following:

   - Insert the sample MP4 video over the **PLACE YOUR VIDEO HERE** box.
   - Replace **Title** with the title of your course.
   - Replace **Subtitle** with **Video Course Sample**
   - Replace **Speaker's Name**, and **Role/Title** with your name, role or title.

5. In two or more of the other slides, continue to add sample content.
6. Delete any slides from your Hello World video sample that you did not use.
7. Go to the [KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues) in GitHub.
8. Attach the Hello World video to the issue that you created for your course in the backlog.
