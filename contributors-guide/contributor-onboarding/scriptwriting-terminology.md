# Scriptwriting Style 

When recording your script, refer to the [VMware Marketing Editorial Style Guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/editorial-style-guide/marketing-editorial-style-guide.pdf) for specific instructions on VMware branding guidelines, voice and tone, and inclusive terminology for recording videos. 

## Terminology Do's and Do Not's

The following terminology guidelines identify specific types of terms that you cannot use in your scripts. For a list of terminology that you cannot use in scripts or workshops submitted to KubeAcademy, go to https://source.vmware.com/portal/pages/global-marketing/terminology-changes.

When writing a script, consider the following do's and do not's.

- **Do** 
   - Use active voice verbs in your script.
   - Use gender-neutral terminology, unless it is relevant to the content. For example, use **they** instead of **he** or **she** and **person hours** instead of **man hours**. 
   - Use non-violent terms that imply pain or degradation. For example, use **turn off the switch** instead of **kill the switch**.
   - Use terms that are free of ableism. For example, use **challenge** instead of **handicap**; use **confidence check** instead of **sanity check**.
- **Do not** 
   - Use passive voice verbs in your script.
   - Use terminology that is jargon and slang.
   - Use charged terminology. This includes words with shock value that demean, hurt, imply negative judgment.
