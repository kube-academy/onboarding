# Video Lighting

There are many ways to use lighting in a video, including one-point lighting, two-point lighting, and three-point lighting.

- **One-point lighting** is made up of a single, key light. You can position the key light as top-down, side, or ring lighting.
- **Two-point lighting** is made up of a key light, and a fill light. The key light is the primary, and brightest light between the two. The purpose of the fill light is to improve the illumination of the key light by lightening the shadows in a video. 
- **Three point lighting** is made up of a key light, a fill light, and a backlight. The key light is the primary, and brightest light between the two. The purpose of the fill light is to improve the illumination of the key light by lightening the shadows in a video. The backlight provides depth to the video by creating a rim light that pushes you away from the background. 

Note: The use of video lighting in your video is optional.
