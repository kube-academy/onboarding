# KubeAcademy Welcomes Content Contributor Submissions 

KubeAcademy from VMware welcomes content contributions from Kubernetes experts in the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities. With Kubernetes technology always evolving, the need to continually provide learners with relevant, timely and defect-free content is essential.

If you are interested in contributing content to KubeAcademy, you must have a GitHub account. This is because KubeAcademy uses two GitHub repositories to manage content. 

- [KubeAcademy Onboarding](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding). This repository is where you start the contributor onboarding process. It is where you find guides and instructions about access control, audio, lab best practices logistics, presentation, skills, and videos.  
- [KubeAcademy Content Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). This repository is where you go to report [content bugs](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md) or [outdated content][reporting outdated content](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md) at KubeAcademy. This is also where you go to [submit a content proposal](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues) for new content that you would like to create such as a lesson, course or lab.
