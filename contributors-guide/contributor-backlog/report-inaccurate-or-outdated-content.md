# Report Inaccurate or Outdated Content

KubeAcademy appreciates your taking the time to report content that is inaccurate or out of date in a course, course description, or lab at KubeAcademy. 

To notify KubeAcademy of a content discrepancy, do the following:

1. Go to the GitHub [KubeAcademy Content Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog).
2. [Submit an Update Course Request](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md) to report a course that requires a major update, has content that is out of date, or is no longer valid, and should be archived.
3. [Add the issue to the KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). The KubeAcademy backlog keeps track of defects, course update requests, and new course proposal ideas.
