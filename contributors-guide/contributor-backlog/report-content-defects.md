# Report Content Defects

One of most beneficial ways Kubernetes enthusiasts can contribute content is to immediately let KubeAcademy know if you encounter a defect in a course, course description, or lab. 

To report a content defect:

1. Go to the GitHub [KubeAcademy Content Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog).
2. [Submit a Defect Report](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md) that describes the issue that you are reporting. If possible, include the steps that you followed before the issue occured. 
3. [Add the issue to the KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). The KubeAcademy backlog keeps track of defects, course update requests, and new course proposal ideas.
