# Report Content Defects

One of most beneficial ways Kubernetes enthusiasts can contribute content is to immediately let us know when there is content that is inaccurate, out of date, or if you encounter a defect in a course, course description, or lab. 

To report a content issue:

1. Go to the GitHub [KubeAcademy Content Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog).
2. Do one of the following:

   - [Submit a Defect Report](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/defect.md) if there is an issue with the content you would like to report. If possible, include steps that reproduce the issue.
   - [Submit an Update Course Request](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding/blob/main/templates/update-course.md) to report a course that requires a major update, has content that is out of date, or is no longer valid, and should be archived.

3. [Add the issue to the KubeAcademy backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues). The KubeAcademy backlog keeps track of defects, course update requests, and new course proposal ideas.
