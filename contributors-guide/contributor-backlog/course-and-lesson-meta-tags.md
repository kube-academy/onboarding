# Course and Lesson Meta Tags

Meta tags provide search engines with information about your content that may not be included in the title and description. To provide metatags, add them to your issue in the [GitHub KubeAcademy Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues).

## Meta Tags

Use the following meta tags to improve search engine optimization for your content.

- **Title**: A unique name that identifies your course. The title tag appears at the top of the web browser and usually becomes a text link to your content in web browser search engine results. When naming your course, lead with “VMware” most of the time. 
- **Description**: One or two sentences that describe the content on the page in a clear, concise, friendly way. The description appears below the title tag in web browser search results. 
- **Key Words**: Metatags that you add to give web browser search engines more information about your content.
- **Course**: The name of your course.
- **Lesson**: The name of a lesson in your course.
- **Video Quality**: A characterstic of a video that is based on factors such as resolution, bitrate and frame rate. Record and export your video at a minimum of 1080p HD minimum. For slow motion recording and video cropping, set the HD quality to 720p. 
- **Framerate**: The frequency that consecutive images display. The frame rate for a professional video is 24 frames per second (FPS).
- **Bitrate**: Provides better color, detail, and video quality in the final product. Use the highest possible bitrate to record your video.
