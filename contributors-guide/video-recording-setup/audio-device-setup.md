# Audio Device Setup

You can verify that the default desktop audio and microphone selected by OBS-Studio during installation are properly working by looking at the Mic/Aux volume meter in the Audio Mixer pane of the OBS main window to ensure that it is moving.

## Manually Update an Audio Device

If the Mic/Aux volume meter is not moving, or you would like to change the audio to a different device, go **OBS** > **Preferences** > **Audio** on the menu bar to manually update the device.
