# Contributor Onboarding

There are a couple of steps to complete during your contributor onboarding. These include:

   - Ensuring that you have the required video equipment, lighting and video recording app to record a high quality video for KubeAcademy.
   - Verifying that the equipment works accurately by submitting a 1-3 minute **Hello World** sample video to KubeAcademy to review.
   - Creating a Contributor's Biography. 
   - Providing course metadata.
