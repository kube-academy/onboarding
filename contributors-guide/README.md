# README

KubeAcademy from VMware welcomes content contributions from Kubernetes experts in the Cloud Native and Kubernetes communities. With Kubernetes technology always advancing, so does the need for learners to have relevant, timely, defect-free content.

## About the Project

KubeAcademy provides free educational material that focuses on exploring how Kuberentes solves business problems and how to successfully implement Kubernetes. KubeAcademy courses discuss open source projects and commercial products in the context of problems they solve, but they are not a substitute for education on Tanzu or any other commercial product. KubeAcademy is not targeted at a specific distribution or implementation of Kubernetes. 

KubeAcademy uses two GitHub repositories to manage content. These include [KubeAcademy Onboarding](https://github.com/kube-academy/onboarding) and [KubeAcademy Content Backlog](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues).

## Mission

The KubeAcademy mission is to lower the entry barrier for anyone who wants to learn Kubernetes by providing free Kubernetes video courses and lab workshops from experienced practitioners. 

## Content Contributions

To become a content contributor at KubeAcademy, create an issue in the [KubeAcademy backlog in GitHub](https://github.com/kube-academy/backlog/issues) and express your interest there. A member of the KubeAcademy team will reach out to you with further instructions. In order to create an issue, you must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). 

There are three ways to contribute content at KubeAcademy. You can:
